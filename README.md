# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## OVERVIEW:
###### An overview of the two additional queries ran for Pewitt-Hackard
After a thorough deep-dive in data from Pewitt-Hackard, our team ran queries on the data to reflect the number of employees, by title, who are approaching retirement so that the company may prepare for the “silver tsunami” of retirees, as well as to establish a mentorship program to help facilitate a smooth transition of titles within the company. These two queries may be found in the Employee_Database_challenge.sql file, in the Queries section of our analysis.

The query for the number of retiring employees by title (D1) yields a table with 133,776 rows (retirement_titles.csv). We noticed that some of the rows in the table had repeating employee numbers due to the change in position or role of certain employees. We revised this query to reflect the retiring employees current titles (unique_titles), which yields a table with 90,398 rows. We then counted the number of retiring employees by title, to break down how many positions will have upcoming retirees.

The mentorship program intends to initiate transitional employment for upcoming retirees, on a part-time basis, in order to train the next phase of employees in their mentor’s former titles. For example, the retiring Senior Engineers would train the next generation of Senior Engineers to come. The program will allow a smooth transition of responsibility within the company.
